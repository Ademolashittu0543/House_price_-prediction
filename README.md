# House Price Prediction  

## Objective  
This project aims to predict house prices using Machine Learning based on various features like location, size, and year built.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains information about houses, including price, number of bedrooms, location, and more.  

## Methods  
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas  
- Cleaned missing values and removed unnecessary columns  
- Trained a regression model to predict prices  

## Challenges  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature selection for better model accuracy  

## What I Learned  
- How to clean and preprocess data using Pandas  
- How to train a regression model in Python  
- The importance of feature engineering  

## Next Steps  
- Improve model accuracy with feature scaling
